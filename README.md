# Mac RubyMotion Examples
This is a repository of various RubyMotion projects that explore and demonstrate various techniques on Mac Cocoa programming

Each sub-project is an attempt to rework an example found that was originally coded in Objective-C or Swift and may have made use of standard Apple development tools (Interface Builder or CoreData editor)
